                    Fortnite is a free to play battle royale game published by Epic Games. Since it's release in 2017, the
                    game
                    has since
                    gained massive popularity.
                    Fortnite has been domminating the battle royale market for quiet a while now, but why ? why is Fortnite
                    so
                    succesful compared to it's competitor
                    like PUBG or DAYZ, how does Fortnite thrive while PUBG and the others failed, is this all just part of a
                    really complicated plot by the shadow government ?
                    is freewill even real ? To find the answer to these burning question we have to go back int time, back
                    to
                    the dark ages of battle royales.

                            The year is 2017, the battle royale genre purely consist of games that are so low in quality
                            that
                            they were almost unplayable. Games such as h1z1 and Ark are some of the example. Yet despite all
                            of the game's problems, the game still manage to pull morbillions of players. This proves that
                            if
                            someone were to make a batlle royale game and didn't completely mess it up, they could probably
                            get
                            alot of money. And with that we get PUBG.

                            PUBG emerges, the sale skyrocketed, and before you know it people spends up to $2000 dollars to
                            buy digital drips. So, what did PUBG do that other games didn't ? nothing.
                            turns out it did exactly what the previous games did, only slightly better. And fortunately
                            for Brendan Green, that's just good enough to be deemed acceptable for the average gamer. Well
                            let's see what PUBG got right and what they didn't.

                                    Was PUBG nice to look at ? not really. But considering how other games looks
                                    at the time, you couldn't really complain. Besides the game was labelled
                                    early access, so i'm not even legally allowed to criticize it for looking bland.

                                    As we all know PUBG is a battle royale. Meaning, you can do anything you want, as long
                                    as you stay in the circle. For example, sitting completely stil with a shotgun, laying
                                    on a hill, or drive around like a maniac. When you load up a game of PUBG you find
                                    yourself surrounded by 100 players. But what happened if you combine an unstable game
                                    engine with 100 players ? well, you get numerous bugs and glitches that just outright 
                                    break the game. But after enough people dies the game runs just fine.

                                    In terms of ballistics and gunplay, PUBG went for something more realistic, except air isn't real.
                                    And the only thing affecting bullet trajectory is gravity. So forget everything you thought you know
                                    about assault rifles, because they now have an effective range of whatever. Basically if you put a 15x
                                    scope on a m249 machine gun and them go prone to apply the bipod, you now have a fully automatic, low
                                    recoil sniper with 100 rounds per magazine.

                                    We've reached the point of no return and you now need to make a choice. You take the blue pill, remain

                                    behind you. You take the red pill, enhance your senses and become one with your surroundings, so that no
                                    one may get close without you knowing it. However, if you choose the red pill, you will soon come to realize 
                                    that there is a price that you have to pay. Your hearing and tinnitus by the age of 20. The game also had proximty
                                    voice chat, but Blue Hole disabled it in lobbies when they found out that it was only used to mic spamming streamers
                                    saying the n-word, and as a marketing tool for hordes of chinese bots.
